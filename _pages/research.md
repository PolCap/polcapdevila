Research
My research can be summarised in three simple words: 

Understand
I belive that understanding how natural systems work is the first, necessary step to develop sustainable societies. Within this conceptual block I am interested in both empirical and theoretical works that help us to better comprehend the dyanmics of natural systems. 
I have been involved in several monitoring programs of marine biodiversity (mostly in the NW Mediterranean) which aimed to describe the population dynamics of marine species but also to understand how these are affected by different natural and human-derived pressures.
I am also interested in testing the generalities of theoretical hypothesis regarding the  how the environmental pressures and evolutionary history influence the evolution of the diverse life histories we observe in our planet.

Predict
Understanding species dynamics will help us to predict their responses to global change. To do this, I combine experimental set ups with field data and demographic models to predict the response of populations to multiple stressors. I also use global scale datasets to simulate different scenarios of the impacts of global change.  
I aim to provide realistic predictions under different global change scenarios. In this regard, I am particularly interested in predicting the impacts of multiple stressors on the structure and functioning of populations and communities.

Manage
Picture
The ultimate goal of my research is to apply our understanding of the natural world and the predictions of the impacts of global change to design effective management and conservation tools. 
​In this regard, I have developed analytical framworks to calculate and compare the resilience of species and populations.
I have also collaborated in conservation projects to design different restoration and coservation actions to protect and recover different marine ecological communities.
